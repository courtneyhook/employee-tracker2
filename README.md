# employee-tracker

## Description

This project is a database of employees with a company. It allows the user to:

- View All Employees
- View All Roles
- View All Departments
- Add/Delete an Employee
- Add/Delete a Role
- Add/Delete a Department
- Update Employee Roles
- View Employees by Managers
- View Employees by Department
- View the Budget

This is a command line program. It was the most challenging....yet most fun project so far. It challenged all my skills (and my patience) but I learn many new skills including async and await.
